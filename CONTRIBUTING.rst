If you would like to contribute to the development of the designer_faimily service and
have never developed for an offical OpenStack project before, you must follow
the steps in this page to perform required setup:

    https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack may be submitted for
review via the Gerrit tool, following the workflow documented at:

    https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

There is a growing suite of documentation for designer_faimily contributors published
at:

    https://docs.openstack.org/designer_faimily/latest/contributor/index.html

Note that OpenStack does not use GitHub. Pull requests and issues submitted
there will not be seen.

Bugs should be filed on StoryBoard:
